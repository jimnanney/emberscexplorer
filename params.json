{"name":"Ember SC Explorer","tagline":"A tutorial application for learning and teaching EmberJS","body":"### Ember SC Explorer.\r\nThis application is a quick tutorial introduction to using Ember JS to consume a public API, Soundcloud's public API. Within the application we will build a sound search, a user browser, and a quick sound player using the sound cloud streaming api.\r\n\r\nEach step along the way is a branch within the repository allowing you to easily roll back and move forward through the tutorial.\r\n\r\nThis will not be a ember cli project, but instead the ember appkit style project, as the initial group I'm presenting too has no access to npm and node.\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\n\r\nTo get started simply clone the repository and checkout branch step1.\r\n\r\nIn your shell (or Git Bash if on windows) clone the repo with the following commands.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/jnanney/emberscexplorer\r\n$ git checkout -b origin/step1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis tutorial is MIT licensed so feel free to clone, modify or use it as you need. I would appreciate any feedback or contributions, and will respond quickly to any issues.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
